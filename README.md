# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com).

* For [AoC 2020](https://github.com/joeygibson/adventofcode2020), I did all my solutions in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). 
* For [AoC 2021](https://github.com/joeygibson/adventofcode2021), I did them all in [Python](https://www.python.org) (even though I
dropped out half-way through the month.)
* For [AoC 2022](https://github.com/joeygibson/adventofcode2022), I did them all in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org). 

For 2023, I'm back to [Python](https://www.python.org).
